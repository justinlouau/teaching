#### UOS Surveys

At the University of Sydney, Unit of Study surveys are sent out twice a semester to help academics improve their teaching.

For the sake of transparency, I share all my survey results publically along with how I've actioned on complaints and areas of improvement, with the exception of surveys with less than 5 particpants. 

**Semester 1 2022**
- S1 Mid
- S1 End

I also occasionally conduct anonomous surveys of my classes outside of these period where I feel nessesary.
